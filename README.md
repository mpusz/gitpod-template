# A C++ CMake template on Gitpod

This is a [C++ CMake](https://clang.llvm.org/) template configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with C++ on Gitpod, copy the contents of this folder to your own project. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

This template is based upon the excellent work by [@lefticus](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project).

### Remove frameworks you're not going to use

If you know you're not going to use one or more of the optional gui/graphics
frameworks (fltk, gtkmm, imgui, etc.), you can remove them with `git rm`:

    $ git rm -r src/<unnecessary_framework>

#### GUI libraries

This project can be made to work with several optional GUI frameworks.

If desired, you should install the following optional dependencies as directed by their documentation, linked here:

- [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.4/index.html)
- [GTKMM](https://www.gtkmm.org/en/documentation.html)
- [QT](https://doc.qt.io/)

The following dependencies can be downloaded automatically by CMake and Conan.
All you need to do to install them is to turn on a CMake flag during
configuration.
If you run into difficulty using them, please refer to their documentation,
linked here:

- [NANA](http://nanapro.org/en-us/documentation/)
- [SDL](http://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage)
- [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs):
  This framework depends on SFML, and if you are using Linux, you may need
  to install several of SFML's dependencies using your package manager. See
  [the SFML build tutorial](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php)
  for specifics.

## Build Instructions

### Build directory
Make a build directory:
```
mkdir build
```
### Specify the compiler using environment variables

By default (if you don't set environment variables `CC` and `CXX`), the system default compiler will be used.

Conan and CMake use the environment variables CC and CXX to decide which compiler to use. So to avoid the conflict issues only specify the compilers using these variables.

CMake will detect which compiler was used to build each of the Conan targets. If you build all of your Conan targets with one compiler, and then build your CMake targets with a different compiler, the project may fail to build.

The environment variables have been pre-defined in the `.gitpod.Dockerfile`.

### Configure your build

To configure the project and write makefiles, you could use `cmake` with a bunch of command line options.
The easier option is to run cmake interactively:

#### **Configure via cmake-gui**:

1) Open cmake-gui from the project directory:
```
cmake-gui .
```
2) Set the build directory:

![build_dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82524586-fa48e380-9af4-11ea-8514-4e18a063d8eb.jpg)

3) Configure the generator:

In cmake-gui, from the upper menu select `Tools/Configure`.

**Warning**: if you have set `CC` and `CXX` always choose the `use default native compilers` option. This picks `CC` and `CXX`. Don't change the compiler at this stage!

<details>
<summary>Windows - MinGW Makefiles</summary>

Choose MinGW Makefiles as the generator:

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows - Visual Studio generator and compiler</summary>

You should have already set `C` and `CXX` to `cl.exe`.

Choose "Visual Studio 16 2019" as the generator:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82524696-32502680-9af5-11ea-9697-a42000e900a6.jpg" alt="default_vs">

</details>

<details>

<summary>Windows - Visual Studio generator and Clang Compiler</summary>

You should have already set `C` and `CXX` to `clang.exe` and `clang++.exe`.

Choose "Visual Studio 16 2019" as the generator. To tell Visual studio to use `clang-cl.exe`:
- If you use the LLVM that is shipped with Visual Studio: write `ClangCl` under "optional toolset to use".

- If you use an external LLVM: write [`LLVM_v142`](https://github.com/zufuliu/llvm-utils#llvm-for-visual-studio-2017-and-2019)
 under "optional toolset to use".

4) Choose the Cmake options and then generate:

![generate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82781591-c97feb80-9e1f-11ea-86c8-f2748b96f516.png)

#### **Configure via ccmake**:
with the Cmake Curses Dialog Command Line tool:

    ccmake -S . -B ./build

Once `ccmake` has finished setting up, press 'c' to configure the project,
press 'g' to generate, and 'q' to quit.

### Build
Once you have selected all the options you would like to use, you can build the
project (all targets):

    cmake --build ./build

For Visual Studio, give the build configuration (Release, RelWithDeb, Debug, etc) like the following:

    cmake --build ./build -- /p:configuration=Release

## Troubleshooting

### Update Conan
Many problems that users have can be resolved by updating Conan, so if you are
having any trouble with this project, you should start by doing that.

To update conan:

    $ pip install --user --upgrade conan

You may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in this command, depending on your
platform.

### Clear Conan cache
If you continue to have trouble with your Conan dependencies, you can try
clearing your Conan cache:

    $ conan remove -f '*'

The next time you run `cmake` or `cmake --build`, your Conan dependencies will
be rebuilt. If you aren't using your system's default compiler, don't forget to
set the CC, CXX, CMAKE_C_COMPILER, and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables, as
described in the 'Build using an alternate compiler' section above.

### Identifying misconfiguration of Conan dependencies

If you have a dependency 'A' that requires a specific version of another
dependency 'B', and your project is trying to use the wrong version of
dependency 'B', Conan will produce warnings about this configuration error
when you run CMake. These warnings can easily get lost between a couple
hundred or thousand lines of output, depending on the size of your project.

If your project has a Conan configuration error, you can use `conan info` to
find it. `conan info` displays information about the dependency graph of your
project, with colorized output in some terminals.

    $ cd build
    $ conan info .

In my terminal, the first couple lines of `conan info`'s output show all of the
project's configuration warnings in a bright yellow font.

For example, the package `spdlog/1.5.0` depends on the package `fmt/6.1.2`.
If you were to modify the file `cmake/Conan.cmake` so that it requires an
earlier version of `fmt`, such as `fmt/6.0.0`, and then run:

    $ conan remove -f '*'       # clear Conan cache
    $ rm -rf build              # clear previous CMake build
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..                  # rebuild Conan dependencies
    $ conan info .

...the first line of output would be a warning that `spdlog` needs a more recent
version of `fmt`.
